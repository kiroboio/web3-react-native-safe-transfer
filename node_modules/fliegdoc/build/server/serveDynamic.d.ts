 * Starts an http server on `port` and serves the documentation.
 *
 * Instead of writing the docs to the actual file system, this just generates them into a "virtual" file system.
 *
 * **NOTE:** This is great for quickly reviewing the docs, but please keep in mind that all files get saved in-memory.
 * If a theme outputs a lot of images or other bigger files, this might pose a problem.
 *
 * @param tree - the documentation tree
 * @param port - the port on which the documentation gets served
 *
 * @throws Error - if the theme isn't browser-viewable, i.e., if {@link Theme.isBrowserViewable} is `false`
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * import { buildTreeForConfig, serveDynamic } from 'fliegdoc';
 *
 * const tree = buildTreeForConfig();
 * serveDynamic(tree, port);
